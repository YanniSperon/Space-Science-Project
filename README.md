# Space-Science-Project

4519 lines of code. A poorly strung together project I made my senior year of high school as I was learning OpenGL. A partner made the art, I did the programming.

This project was a self-directed learning experience in C++ and OpenGL. Developed in one week, with a very small amount of start code borrowed from the original Atlas Engine. The primary goal was to make an engaging visual to accompany a verbal presentation in a space science course.
